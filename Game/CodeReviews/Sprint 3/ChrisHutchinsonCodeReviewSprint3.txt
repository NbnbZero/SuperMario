Comments on Quality:
	- Maybe figure out a way to not make a new vector every time (as we have a memory problem now)
	- Since Items move, maybe put the goLeft and goRight variables in a super class
	- Good naming convention with the lowercase privtae variables
	- Draw could also be put in a super class probably

Minutes Taken: 		10ish
Hypothetical change:
	- What would happen if we wanted to change what the up mushroom did? (like make it a fire mushroom)
		- You would need to update the class name
		- Not much else would change about the class since there's not much in there to begin with.
