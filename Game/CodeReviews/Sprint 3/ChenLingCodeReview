Comments: 
It is easy to read this class. All of the code have a good code quality. 
The camera class contains a position vector, an origin vector, a limit rectangle to define the view. 
However, the float variable Zoom does not make sense to me. I do not understand what its function is. 
Also, the method name "LookAt" and "Move" are kinds of confusing. 

Hypothetical changes:
From the perspective of future work, I think it is relatively easy if the position variable in camera.cs can be changed to static. 
By doing so, in this class, we can create a static cameraReset function, which can be called in game1.
For example, if team wants to do level restart in the future, and it is needed to reset camera, creating a reset function and then calling the cameraReset function is a good try.
Otherwise, the revise work will be increased.
