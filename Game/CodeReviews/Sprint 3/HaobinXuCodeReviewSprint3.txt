Comments on Quality:
	-Overall friendly for others to read and further understand.
	-Every element and variable are sorted so that quite not possible to mix up.

Hypothetical Change:
	-Might be an unnecessary change: could pass in gametime as variable so that this class does not require an 
	 extra "counter" variable to update itself.
	-Also, the class is a bit long but meanwhile necessary. Small refactoration could be applied.
