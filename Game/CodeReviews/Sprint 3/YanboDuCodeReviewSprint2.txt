Comments on Quality:
	- Good readability
	- 0 reference for Update() method and didn't see it has been used anywhere.

Minutes Taken: 10 min

Hypothetical Change:
	- Delete this unused class
	- Or create viewport in the Game.cs, then update and return the visibleSpriteList. In this way, we probably could fix memory leak
	   and do not need to check collision for every sprite.
